The Akamai Quest Extension Training Application offers the ability to completely transform training here at Akamai. By basing it off of the hugely successful 
Project Qui system, and allowing any employee to be an admin or a user/create or partake in trainings that they desire, trainings can be created and completed
at an extremely effective page.

Basic Workflow:

Admin
1. Admin creates an account
2. Admin creates a Project and designs it to his/her own vision
3. Admin Adds Quests to a Project and designs it to her/her own specifications (ex. will it include videos, pictures, etc.)
4. Admin Adds Questions to each Quest


User
1. User creates an account
2. User joins a project that the admin has created
3. The User, starting at the first quest, will answer all of the questions present inside of it, before then moving onto the second quest, and so on...
4. Once the user has successfully answered all of the questions present within all of the quests in a project, the user has completed the training
